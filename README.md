# project0
This is the Project 0 of CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript series.

The dummy website I created was focused on design, rather than functionalities such as actual shopping via web. Thus, it might not be the "Furniture Shopping" website we see on the web.
This was also, the first website I created so I hope you like it!!!
